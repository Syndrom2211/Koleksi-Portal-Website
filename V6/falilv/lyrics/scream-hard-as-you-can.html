<h1>Lyrics</h1>
<p>I am gonna take all pain you carry (and) pull you out from the dark!<br/>
<br/>
"it's not this and it's not that..."<br/>
mumbling the same phrases over and over<br/>
can't make the right decision<br/>
feel's like you've been thrown somewhere on your own<br/>
suddenly, in middle of no where with no others to talk or (to) rely on<br/>
<br/>
Despondency<br/>
nostalgic memories entwines you like a vine<br/>
stabs you with thorns<br/>
<br/>
You carry so much pain inside<br/>
why do you act to be strong?<br/>
you bluff and say you are okay<br/>
wicked smile proves you aren't<br/>
don't you be crying because sad face does not suit you<br/>
all I want is you<br/>
please keep smiling<br/>
<br/>
Sun shine gradually fades away and clouds the answer<br/>
stay strong<br/>
<br/>
Formulas and equations is no longer there<br/>
decisions are up to you<br/>
<br/>
Identity<br/>
examine really carefully<br/>
see what's there<br/>
look what is there<br/>
how does it reflect on to the mirror?<br/>
do not face away from reality<br/>
Scrutinize from the whorl of your hair right to the tip of your toe<br/>
what do you notice inside?<br/>
can you see?<br/>
yourself crying and your wounded heart<br/>
<br/>
On and on tragedy happens<br/>
it is one of the routines we go through<br/>
<br/>
Do get used to heart breaking news because it's something that isn't necessary<br/>
<br/>
Drops of tears are the shape of your pain which cannot be express by words<br/>
it's the only tangible object that let people recognize your wounds<br/>
don't be afraid to cry or weep anytime you want to<br/>
<br/>
Scars will heal someday<br/>
<br/>
I will be waiting for you<br/>
you will be alright and rise up again<br/>
clouds that have blocked the light will vanish away<br/>
and sun light will shine<br/>
<br/>
Have confidence in all your decisions<br/>
<br/>
The more you cry, the stronger you'll be<br/>
let the time heal all your scars</p><br/>
