<h1>Lyrics</h1>
<p>Summer has now come<br/>
Wow!<br/>
The time to jump at the beach has now arrived<br/>
<br/>
Come on, lets play with us<br/>
Why don't we hop around the hot summer shore<br/>
Forget all the boring stuff we got to care and have fun<br/>
<br/>
The sun shines bright upon the sky<br/>
Tanning our skin hot and brown<br/>
This place is our play ground for us to play<br/>
<br/>
Everyday we have to bother with many shits<br/>
I know how it really suck but for now why not party and jump all night long with us<br/>
I get how you feel so dull to face problems you would never want but for now lets jump and sing all night long<br/>
<br/>
Jump now!<br/>
Shake the floor and shake the earth with both of your feet<br/>
Create and feel the beat<br/>
<br/>
Jump as high as the sky<br/>
<br/>
The sun is falling into the blue ocean<br/>
Coloring the scenery into orange but its not over<br/>
<br/>
Even if the round glowing moon comes rising the fun never ends and will last forever<br/>
Lets dance<br/>
Jump until next morning<br/>
Party all day<br/>
Let's all hold hands and jump around the fire<br/>
<br/>
Do not be scared<br/>
You can always come back here anytime<br/>
We won't leave you so do not worry<br/>
This place will stay forever<br/>
<br/>
Stars shine and light from up high<br/>
Telling us that the party will not end<br/>
Hey, are you ready to jump now?<br/>
<br/>
We have to bother with many shits<br/>
I know how it really suck but for now why not party and jump all night long with us<br/>
I get how you feel so dull to face problems you would never want but for now lets jump and sing all night long<br/>
<br/>
Jump now!</p><br/>
