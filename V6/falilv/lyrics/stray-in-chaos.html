<h1>Lyrics</h1>
<p>We have been walking miles and miles along this road<br/>
We are (a) wayfarer<br/>
Our journey never ends<br/>
<br/>
Travelling all four point wherever (the) wind blows<br/>
Do not hold any bag<br/>
Courage is all you need<br/>
<br/>
There are peaks and valley of life<br/>
Keep walking like a man in (a) trance<br/>
<br/>
Stand on the starting line<br/>
Lift your foot and stamp it on the Earth<br/>
<br/>
Wake Up x2<br/>
Believe yourself<br/>
Listen (to) your instinct<br/>
Decide your way<br/>
<br/>
Wake Up x2<br/>
Believe yourself<br/>
Listen (to) your instinct<br/>
Decide your way<br/>
<br/>
Get x2 up on your feet<br/>
Breathe in and take a step<br/>
<br/>
Sun x4 will shine all the way<br/>
<br/>
Get x2 up on your feet<br/>
Breathe in and take a step<br/>
Go forward<br/>
<br/>
Don't let it stop<br/>
Until you reach your goal<br/>
There are no choice for you to take but to go forward<br/>
<br/>
Don't let it stop<br/>
Thingsyou've never met exists in the World<br/>
It's will surely make your journey worthy<br/>
<br/>
Go!!<br/>
We'll run until we die<br/>
<br/>
Thunder rolled<br/>
Storm has struck<br/>
Rain poured down<br/>
<br/>
There is no use moving back<br/>
You can't trace back your path<br/>
It's sad but we never meet without farewell<br/>
<br/>
Time has passed a while since we had last met<br/>
It's sad but we never meet without farewell<br/>
<br/>
There is no use moving back<br/>
You can't trace back your path<br/>
It's sad but we never meet without farewell<br/>
<br/>
Time has passed a while since we had last met<br/>
It's sad but we never meet without farewell<br/>
<br/>
Life is like a voyage<br/>
Won't end until we die</p><br/>
