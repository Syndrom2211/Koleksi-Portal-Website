<h1>Lyrics</h1>
<p>Rain, the rain<br/>
pours down on me<br/>
soaks my shoulders<br/>
I walk all alone<br/>
with no umbrella<br/>
"tear drops from sky high, wash my emotions away from me now..."<br/>
wishing as I gaze up the sky with saddened eyes<br/>
but I know it has no use at all<br/>
<br/>
Wonder why I'm here by myself<br/>
I try to search for your trace<br/>
but can't find it...<br/>
as my tears fell the pouring rain turned to drizzle<br/>
<br/>
Sing a song with my clothes wet<br/>
the song I wrote for you who's gone<br/>
I'll keep walking and I will have my head up high<br/>
the ley-line could it be a spirits way?<br/>
can it be a dead way I try to walk?<br/>
either way I will keep moving my feet<br/>
<br/>
Puddles reflect me<br/>
my eye sight so clear<br/>
now I can look all the way<br/>
I can see far out<br/>
<br/>
Foot prints<br/>
trace of path remained on the surface<br/>
it's the evidence that I am alive<br/>
the rainbow hanged over the blue sky like an arc<br/>
connects the distance between you and i<br/>
rain is gone and sun has risen<br/>
<br/>
I raise my hands because the sun start to smile<br/>
damped sneakers have dried up<br/>
I take a stretch and breath in fresh air to fill my lungs<br/>
now I'll start to walk again<br/>
<br/>
Knew that I'm the only one who could save myself<br/>
I am the one that has to step up (and) crash all the walls<br/>
that stands u high against me and take the challenge<br/>
<br/>
Sing a song under the sun<br/>
the song I wrote after you left<br/>
I'll keep walking and I promise to keep walking<br/>
the ley-line guess it is a spirits way<br/>
cannot be a death way which I am on<br/>
wither way I will keep moving my feet<br/>
<br/>
I used to regret for what I have lost,<br/>
but I guess it makes no mean so I'll move on<br/>
<br/>
I'll sing to the sky</p><br/>
