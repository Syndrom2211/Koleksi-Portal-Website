<h1>Lyrics</h1>
<p>Te wo nobashita no ni mada todokanai<br/>
yogoto seiron iya ni naru<br/>
benri na iiwake wo haimawaru shoudou<br/>
(From)time to time, I feel like running away<br/>
Trying to face away from this situation<br/>
<br/>
Feel so lonely in this world<br/>
<br/>
But for me to live I have to decide my own way<br/>
<br/>
Take it easy<br/>
It's gonna be alright<br/>
Have faith and trust what a person you are<br/>
In times when you feel lost believe yourself<br/>
Overcome all the enemies<br/>
Are you ready? Let's go!!<br/>
Chill out and be easygoing sometimes<br/>
That was what you've told me in bad times<br/>
<br/>
Karamaru ito hodoita toki ni waraitai kara<br/>
mayoeru hibi mo tashikameru<br/>
sagasenakute me wo sorasu kedo<br/>
kimi nara dekiru<br/>
sono te wo nobase<br/>
<br/>
Fog hanged over<br/>
Making me blind<br/>
I cut through the air with my hand<br/>
<br/>
And then I realized I ran into a wonderland filled with mysteries<br/>
I knew if I kept running without stopping I will someday find the way out from here<br/>
<br/>
Take a look around<br/>
Each one of us shares different thoughts and features<br/>
No one is the same and that's what makes us the only special<br/>
<br/>
Spring has arrived<br/>
Season of new life has come<br/>
sou toumei de mabayui ashita e<br/>
We all face and go through tough moments<br/>
But with the help of others we gain the power to stand up again</p><br/>
