<h1>Lyrics</h1>
<p>Road stretches to all directions<br/>
north, east, and south, west<br/>
<br/>
It goes on and on forever<br/>
simple but yet complicated tangles and untangles<br/>
life is like a walkway<br/>
it goes awfully smooth sometimes but goes tough<br/>
just look how a road goes up and down, right and left<br/>
<br/>
Life goes on in different directions<br/>
stretches perfectly straight<br/>
crosses over in time to time<br/>
signals guides us what to do and not to<br/>
but there aren't signals in our life<br/>
it's up to us to discover as an individual man<br/>
what is right and wrong in course of life<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing called "short cuts" in our life<br/>
it's the small steps that pile up and make us a better man<br/>
<br/>
You can walk towards left, right, or straight<br/>
you can walk anywhere anytime but not backwards<br/>
<br/>
On a crossroad we tend to bump into each other<br/>
fight with many people<br/>
laps over many roads<br/>
just keep walking, if you don't stop someday we will achieve what we've aimed<br/>
take the upcoming chance<br/>
so we go<br/>
<br/>
Life and road in many ways<br/>
interacting with others<br/>
laughing, fighting, and crying<br/>
we crossover</p><br/>
